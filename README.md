## 📋 Project Overview
This project applied **Business Process Intelligence (BPI)** techniques to model and optimize a **flood crisis management process**.  
Using SQL, PRoM, Iterop, and BIMP, the team discovered process behavior, analyzed deviations, and automated workflows to improve efficiency.

---

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**, **Python**, **PRoM**, **Iterop**, **BIMP Simulator**
- **Database:** Oracle / MongoDB (localhost)
- **Front-end:** React.js for ER diagram visualization

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Representation:** Modeled process with ER diagrams and cleaned logs.  
2. **Process Mining:** Discovered patterns and bottlenecks using PRoM and SQL.  
3. **Conformance Checking:** Applied Levenshtein distance for deviation detection.  
4. **Automation:** Implemented workflows in Iterop with conditional gateways.  
5. **Simulation:** Calibrated scenarios in BIMP to test resource allocation.

## 📈 Key Results
| Scenario | Duration | Cost (€) | Completed Crises |
|-----------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Weak Organization | 115.5 weeks | 445,702 | 3 |
| Intermediate | 147.7 weeks | 534,729 | 4 |
| Optimized | **44 weeks** | **495,051** | **4** |

✅ The optimized configuration reduced total crisis response time from **>2 years to 10 months**.

## 🧠 My Contributions (Mintesnot Yimer)
- Wrote **SQL scripts** for log cleaning and indicator calculation.  
- Performed **conformance checking** (deviation analysis with Levenshtein distance).  
- Designed and implemented **automation workflows** in **Iterop**.  
- Participated in **simulation tuning** in BIMP.  

---

## 💡 Insights
- Automating notifications reduced delays and human errors.  
- Resource reallocation improved overlap crisis management.  
- Integration of LLMs can further enhance real-time decision support.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Import cleaned log files into Oracle/SQL.  
2. Use PRoM to generate Petri Nets and social networks.  
3. Deploy the process in Iterop and run simulations in BIMP.
